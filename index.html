                    Hello my name is Rodney, I am a new and aspiring web developer. Currently working my way through Northwestern Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. At the moment of typing this I am on week 2 of the bootcamp.
                    I am really enjoying it and learning a lot. It's a bit difficult in some parts, especially to understand the advanced parts of CSS but I'm pushing through and powering through in order to learn and understand.
                    I have a somewhat background in computing. When I was in high school I took a very basic coding course my senior year. I don't remember the name of the program but it was more or less one of those
                    coding websites that teach you coding but just plugging and placing code that they already gave you. However when I went to college I took up computer science as my major and their I was mostly
                    focused on my GenEd's but I also took two computer courses. Then I took a break from school and coding and now I am back wanting to learn and jump start my career. So this is my portfolio with
                    all of my current projects and it will also be the place I put my future projects as well.
