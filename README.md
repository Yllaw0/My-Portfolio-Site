# My-Portfolio-Site

## Description
This is a webpage that I created that was for my portfolio. It is in the beginner stages because I am still learning. It is coded with both HTML and CSS. It details a brief history of my coding past going through both high school and college then all the way to where I am now with taking the NorthWestern Coding Bootcamp. Then it displays projects that I have worked on with the largest one being the only project that I actually worked on and the two smaller images being just place holders and examples projects that will eventually go there once I get more experience under my belt. Lastly on the farest right side of the webpage I have my contact information like phone number, email address, and my github account in order to see the portfolio site and other projects that I have worked on.

## Usage

The use of this site is to look at the project work history of mine and learn more about me. By clicking the 'About Me', 'Work', or 'Contact Me' links at the top of the page it will direct you to the part of the webpage you are looking for. Then if you were to click on a specific project for example the first one it will send you to another webpage with that project displayed in another tab. Also if the screen is rezied it is shaped to screen of mobile devices.
